        I am a skilled and passionate Full Stack Web Developer currently in my
        3rd year of B-Tech in information technology at Atharva College of
        Engineering in Malad. I have used these technologies extensively to
        build a variety of websites and applications. The MERN stack is
        particularly useful for building full-stack web applications. Tailwind
        CSS is a powerful utility-first CSS framework that helps to make my CSS
        more maintainable and efficient. Firebase is a great tool for building
        scalable, real-time web and mobile applications. As a leader of my team
        for the past three academic projects, I have developed a deep
        understanding of team management and project planning ðŸ’¼. I am confident
        in my ability to apply my knowledge and skills to build something truly
        great during a hackathon ðŸ’». With a passion for technology and a drive
        to succeed ðŸš€, I am a valuable asset to any team and am sure to make a
        significant impact in the world of web development âœ¨.
